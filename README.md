### Express Class Build Example - 2026

Our first Express server! This is a simple Express application that demonstrates how to set up an Express server, manage sessions, and serve static files. It also includes a custom middleware function to track the number of views in a session.

#### Getting Started
Download the code using `git clone` or by downloading the ZIP file from GitHub. Then, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using `npm install`.

#### Running the server
`npm start`

This command runs the server 'start' script defined in `package.json`. By default, it listens on port 3000. You can test it by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser or using a tool like `curl`.
